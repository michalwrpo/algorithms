# Algorithms
## by Michał Waluś

A collection of chosen algorithms in multiple programming languages.

I'm open to suggestions for optimalizations and fixes, but because I'm treating this as a learning experience, I'm not accepting commits with your implementations.

### Pseudocodes

A few characteristics of pseudocodes I write in this repository:
- Style of code is similar to python, i.e. no curly brackets are used and lines with declatarions of loops, if statements and functions end with colon (:).
- Array indexing starts from 0, similarly to most programming languages.
- Accessing nth element of an array is denoted by `A[n - 1]`.
- `length` function is used to mean length of an array or similar object.
- Comments are denoted by `//`
- Ranges of loops are written in form `i = a to b` and include both endpoint. 
  - Range `i = 0 to 5` means the loop will execute for all i $\in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.
  - Range `i = 5 down to 0` means i will start as 5 and decrease by 1 each iteration.
